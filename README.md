# Jathin R Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is a modern, responsive site showcasing my work as a passionate data analyst and web developer specializing in Gen AI and technologies like Python, Flask, React, and JavaScript. The website features smooth scroll snapping, animated transitions, and a starry night background for an immersive experience.

**Note**: This GitHub repository contains only documentation and screenshots of the website. The actual source code is not included here, as the site is deployed separately. For inquiries about the code or collaborations, feel free to contact me via the details below.

## About the Website
This portfolio is designed to highlight my skills, projects, certifications, and ways to connect. Key features include:
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Full-page snap scrolling with smooth behavior.
- **Animations**: Subtle fade-in effects with a "paper flip" transition for section reveals.
- **Starry Background**: A fixed, immersive starry night image that spans the entire site.
- **Sections**:
  - **Hero/About Me**: Introduction with avatar, bio, and call-to-action buttons.
  - **Projects**: Grid of project cards with descriptions and "View Code" buttons.
  - **Certificates**: Display of key certifications with details and view links.
  - **Get in Touch**: Social links for LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.

The site is built using React for the UI, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for animations, ensuring a clean, user-centric experience.
