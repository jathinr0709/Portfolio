# Jathin R Portfolio Website 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! 🌟 This is a modern, responsive site showcasing my work as a passionate data analyst and web developer specializing in Gen AI and technologies like Python, Flask, React, and JavaScript. The website features smooth scroll snapping, animated transitions, and a starry night background for an immersive experience.

**Note**: This GitHub repository contains only documentation and screenshots of the website. 📄 The actual source code is not included here, as the site is deployed separately. For inquiries about the code or collaborations, feel free to contact me via the details below.

## About the Website
This portfolio is designed to highlight my skills, projects, certifications, and ways to connect. Key features include:
- **Responsive Design** 📱: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Smooth Scrolling** ⬇️: Full-page snap scrolling with smooth behavior.
- **Animations** 🎥: Subtle fade-in effects with a "paper flip" transition for section reveals.
- **Starry Background** ⭐: A fixed, immersive starry night image that spans the entire site.
- **Sections** 📑:
  - **Hero/About Me**: Introduction with avatar, bio, and call-to-action buttons.
  - **Projects**: Grid of project cards with descriptions and "View Code" buttons.
  - **Certificates**: Display of key certifications with details and view links.
  - **Get in Touch**: Social links for LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.

The site is built using React for the UI, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for animations, ensuring a clean, user-centric experience. 💻
